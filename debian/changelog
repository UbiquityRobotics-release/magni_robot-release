ros-noetic-magni-description (0.5.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Moved extrinsics yamls from param/ to extrinsics/
  * core.launch is now generated by empy
  * Added default cam positions, prettier printing
  * removed extrinsics by each coordinate in urdf
  * extrinsics yaml file is loaded directly into urdf
  * Fist testing of launch file generation on the robot
  * Added license files to all magni packages
  * Merge pull request #146 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/magni_robot/issues/146> from Polonium19/indigo-devel
  * Update camera 'Ahead' position to straight vertically
